# MKV Renamer

A simple, modern WinForms app to:
- Rename the **main movie** to match its folder (e.g., `Movie Title (2022).mkv`)
- Move selected files to an **Extras** subfolder
- Batch rename extras like `Extras - 01.mkv`, `Extras - 02.mkv`…
- Create a new movie folder (with optional `Extras`)

## Download
Grab the latest **MKV-Renamer-1.0.0-win-x64.zip** from [Releases](../../releases).

- Unzip anywhere and run `MKV Renamer.exe`.
- If it doesn’t start, install **.NET Desktop Runtime 8** (only needed if the zip isn’t self-contained).
